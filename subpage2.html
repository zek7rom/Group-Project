            <p>The employers and companies within the cybersecurity field need to implement change in order to create more diverse jobs and end the systemic racism we are seeing within the field itself. It is clear that this issue is not at the priority of many in the United States, however it should be as our cyber field is evidentially lacking. A major solution could be to create programs that expose diverse communities, specifically of younger generations, to the cybersecurity field.</p>

            <p>The Article <a href="https://www.ntsc.org/resources/ntsc-blog/cybersecurity-diversity-cannot-be-solved-by-tools-or-policy,-but-by-the-way-we-think.html">“Cybersecurity diversity cannot be solved by tools or policy but by the way we think”</a> 
             written by Helen Patton, the Chief information security officer of Ohio State University discusses the lack of women that exist within the field of cybersecurity, along with their also being a low percentage of ethic/racial minorities who currently hold job positions within Cybersecurity. In a brief overview of Helen Patton’s professional integrity and credentials written by the office of compliance and integrity from OSU Helen Patton has 20 years of experience in security, information risk and technology, along with a certification in Information Systems Auditor and Risk and Systems Control, from ISACA (which is an International professional association that governs IT). So, in general she has an abundance of knowledge within the field, tons of exposure to the workplace and worked with other cybersecurity professions throughout her 20 years within the field, therefore having a keen understanding of the cyber security demographic and what it consists of. Within the article Helen Patton also discussed there not being any policies that directly focus on how a company should go about promoting diversity within the workforce; she also discussed how policy makers and the U.S in general don’t deem the lack of diversity within the field of cybersecurity a top issue, which is why there hasn’t been any real discussion on potential solutions that could better diversify the cybersecurity workforce. Helen Patton also discussed the cultural biases within society having an influence in the field, and also influence the type of people that are hired and hold positions within cybersecurity. The article also discussed attempts to change the hiring process and also encourage creating programs that will expose young girls to technology and cybersecurity. Overall, this article brings awareness to the lack of diversity within the cyber workface and addresses multiple issues that contribute to why the field isn’t as diverse as it could be; this article also discusses some solutions that could be made in order to encourage diversify and get people excited for the ever-growing field of cybersecurity.
