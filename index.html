            <h1>The Lack of Diversity in Cybersecurity</h1>

            <p>The issues of systemic racism and lack of diversity in the cybersecurity field is an issue that needs to be addressed today in the United States. This lack of diversity is causing the cyber field to suffer in the United States compared to other countries. The government and field itself have made little progress in fixing the issues of systemic racism in the field, but there are solutions to these problems that could be put in place.  </p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h2></h2>
            <p>The article  <a href="https://www.mincybsec.org" target="_blank">“What is Minorities in Cybersecurity(MIC)?”</a> from the Council on Foreign Relations discusses the systemic racism and lack of diversity in the cybersecurity field, and how that will impact cybersecurity in this country in general. The author is Camille Stewart, who worked at the Department of Homeland Security as the senior policy adviser for cyber, infrastructure, and reliance policy under former President Barack Obama. She talks about how diversity in the field would help benefit in the cybersecurity world. Stewart state that diversity opens up more ideas for cybersecurity in combat. She compares cybersecurity in the U.S. to other countries, showing how they are taking more of a priority in diversifying the field. This could explain why those countries have more advanced cyber security compared to here in the United States. The fact that the U.S. lacks diversity makes it harder to reach its full potential in the field. With the lack of diversity in the field, it is harder to create cybersecurity that will work for all Americans. This article is very reliable and helpful because it shows some ways that inequality exist in the cybersecurity field, and how it can impact our cyber development as a country. Additionally, the author specifically worked for the department of homeland security when Obama was in office, giving her more credibility. This article could be viewed as a little left learning, but overall, there isn’t truly any political bias. Overall, Stewart wants the cybersecurity field to educate themselves on the systemic racism they are creating and create more diverse jobs to revive a new and more helpful perspective in the industry. This article supports our claim and helps other understand the reasons why we need diversity.   </p>
