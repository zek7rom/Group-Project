            <p>The issue of systemic racism and lack of diversity in the cybersecurity field is not a priority for government officials, however, it should be. There are many solutions the government can put in place to assist the issue; the government just needs to start implementing them. Some solutions include creating access to cyber education in less fortunate areas with lower quality colleges, rather than just 4-year universities. Another solution could be to make the requirements for working in this field lower, so that these certain minorities could even have a chance. It is clear that this diverse opinion is needed to advance the United States cybersecurity, the government just needs to start doing something about it.</p>

            <p><i>Vincent Brandi.</i> <a href="">“Government Needs to Diversify Its Cyber Workforce.”</a> <i>Nextgov, 23 May 2019:</i></p>  
            <br>
            <p>Brandi Vincent, a reporter for Nextgov, discusses the changes the federal government needs to make in order to solve the lack of diversity and representation of minorities in the cybersecurity field and workforce. She discusses the incredibly low statistics of minority representation in the field now, and how the government needs to increase funding for education in this field. The information she provides are from lawmakers and panelists who all have experience in the cybersecurity field. She discusses how Richard Gallot Jr., the President of Grambling State University, wants the government to work on increasing access to cyber education for those in rural areas with less opportunities, rather than just 4-year universities. The other panelists agree with this and explain how to work in cybersecurity, 4-year degrees should not be a requirement. They emphasize a push on the federal government to increasing funding for other education programs to make it easier for minorities, and those less fortunate, to get jobs in this field. A solution Amelia Estwick, an educator with experience in federal cyber operations, suggests the government should start creating mentorship and sponsorship programs for minorities interested in this field. Overall, Vincent supports what these lawmakers and panelists are suggesting, as these are solutions the federal government must waste no time in making. This article supports the issues in the lack of diversity and systemic racism that exists in the cybersecurity field and how they are becoming a bigger issue that needs to be addressed by the government. It was a very helpful and reliable source used to provide further solutions the government needs to make for this issue being addressed.
