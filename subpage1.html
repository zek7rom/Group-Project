            <p>There has been little done to help this issue, but some education training organizations of these cybersecurity companies, like the Infosec Institute, are bringing this issue into their training programs. They are encouraging companies to implement solutions that will bring their companies, and eventually the cybersecurity field itself, to a more diverse workforce. While this issue has been going on for many years now, it is finally starting to come to the attention of the public and these cybersecurity companies are starting to make a change.</p>

                <p>This article was written but the InfoSec Institute. This organization is a cybersecurity education provider that works to train the workforce in the field. Infosec discusses how Latino and Black employees have such a low representation in the workforce, even across many large organizations of the field. They provide data from an “Information Security Analyst” that demonstrates this clearly. The organization created a list of solutions that they are encouraging the cybersecurity workforce to use in order to increase diversity in the field. These solutions include encouraging diversity, mentoring, building a more inclusive culture, and training programs. By putting these in place there should be more diverse jobs from board level down, positive role models in the workplace to reach out to, an environment in the workplace where voices are equally heard and taken with equal respect, and training programs to allow minorities to grow in this field and get the jobs they deserve. This article was a very reliable source with little bias from an organization that works to actually train these cybersecurity companies, and it is clear the diversity training is starting to be put in place. It was a very helpful source that provided solutions to our topic that are already being encouraged. The article emphasizing our main point of how the cybersecurity field needs to pull together workers from all different cultures in order to fully manage the cybersecurity problems this country is facing today.
